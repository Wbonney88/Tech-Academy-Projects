"""    The purpose of this project was to write a program that meets all of the following criteria.
1. Assign an integer to a variable

2. Assign a string to a variable

3. Assign a float to a variable

4. Use the print function and .format() notation to print out the variable you assigned  

5. Use each of these operators +, - , * , / , +=, Â­= , %

6. Use of logical operators: and, or, not

7. Use of conditional statements: if, elif, else

8. Use of a while loop

9. Use of a for loop

10. Create a list and iterate through that list using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

11. Create a tuple and iterate through it using a for loop to print each item out on a new line

12. Define a function that returns a string variable

13. Call the function you defined above and print the result to the shell

This program is created to take in information and return some random predictions
about the user."""
