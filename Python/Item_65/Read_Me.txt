This script was created for the Tech Academy Python course item 65.  Use the "file_transfer" file to run the program.
Currently the main file is saved as a .pyw so that it can be run on Windows without the command window.
It's my understanding this file type can't be run on other operating systems, so I included a copy of the file in .py format if needed.
